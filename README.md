# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains my first machine learning projects, showcasing my journey into the world of data science and machine learning. The projects focus on binary classification tasks, where I explored essential concepts, tackled challenges, and learned how to implement machine learning algorithms effectively.

- **Goal**: Classify sonar signals to determine whether the object is a rock or a mine.
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Binary classification  
  - Train-test splitting  
  - Logistic regression and sigmoid function  
- **Results**:  
  - Training Accuracy: ~83%  
  - Testing Accuracy: ~76%  
- **Learn More**: [Rock Vs Mine README](#)

### 2. Diabetes Prediction

- **Goal**: Predict whether a patient is diabetic based on medical data.
- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Data standardization  
  - Handling class imbalance  
  - SVM with linear kernel  
- **Results**:  
  - Training Accuracy: ~78%  
  - Testing Accuracy: ~77%  
- **Learn More**: [Diabetes README](#)

## Technologies and Tools

The following libraries and tools were used for both projects:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `numpy` for numerical computations  
  - `scikit-learn` for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing

## Key Learnings
- The importance of preprocessing techniques like standardization and handling class imbalance.
- Applying algorithms like logistic regression and SVM to real-world datasets.
- Debugging and interpreting model performance metrics such as accuracy.

## Future Work
- Explore multi-class classification problems.
- Implement additional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Try advanced algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
